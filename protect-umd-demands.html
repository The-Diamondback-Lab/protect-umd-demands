            <p style="margin-left: -10px;">At university President Wallace Loh’s request, some senior administrators met
                Friday to review ProtectUMD's demands. The group included the chief diversity officer, Loh’s chief of
                staff, the provost, the vice president of administration and finance and the vice president of student
                affairs.</p>
            <p style="margin-left: -10px;"> Brian Ullmann, a university spokesman who was present at the meeting, sent
                The Diamondback the following statement Sunday: "At President Loh's request, a group of senior
                administrators conducted an initial review of the letter submitted by ProtectUMD. Many of the items are
                already in place and others require additional evaluation. We look forward to working with students,
                faculty and staff on efforts to advance our strategic plan on diversity and inclusion.”</p>

                                and Greek life organizations is already partially underway.</p>
                            <p> Sororities and fraternities must provide multicultural competence programming in order
                                to be recognized by the university, said Corin Gioia Edwards, Department of Fraternity
                                and Sorority Life advising and programming associate director. </p>
                            <p> However, the training isn’t uniform, so each organization can choose what works best for
                                them. Some groups may bring in a speaker, such as a representative from the Office of
                                Multicultural Involvement and Community Advocacy. </p>
                            <p> Implementing a consistent training across all Greek organizations would be ideal,
                                Edwards said, but she isn’t sure it is possible to coordinate with 59 groups and more
                                that 4,000 students. </p>
                            <p> “It’s more just like a logistical: ‘What would the training look like?’; ‘Who would be
                                responsible for doing it?’; ‘How would it get tracked?’” she said. “In theory, I would
                                love that for all of our students.” </p>

                                training for all its officers at its final meeting of the semester Dec. 1. </p>
                            <p> SGA Speaker of the Legislature Chris Ricigliano, a junior government and politics and
                                history major, said it’s important for the body to understand diversity-related issues.
                            </p>
                            <p> “We hope to get all of our members of the SGA trained in cultural competency, so we can
                                be a more informed body when we’re debating and making decisions,” he said. “It’s
                                important that we recognize different issues that are in campus spaces and try to
                                approach them in a respectful way.” </p>
                            <p> SGA President Katherine Swanson, a senior government and politics major said the idea of
                                requiring competency training for all SGA-recognized organizations is one the body has
                                not yet addressed. </p>
                            <p> “I’m interested in exploring the idea, but would need legislative approval to officially
                                pursue it,” she said. </p>

                            <p>Freshman Taylor Turner said she was supposed to see a counselor about three weeks ago,
                                but is still waiting.</p>
                            <p> The Counseling Center has “a lot of people on their list,” said Turner, who identifies
                                as African American and Indian. “I was supposed to be assigned a counselor like three
                                weeks ago and I still haven’t so, they kind of like take a long time to get back to you.
                                Now it’s finals and I’m just like, well, maybe next semester.”</p>
                            <p> The Counseling Center is <a

                                    target="_blank" class="red">understaffed and underfunded</a>, and a long waiting
                                list is expected, The Diamondback reported Nov. 2015. </p>
                            <p> The center’s policy allows students eight free individual counseling sessions per year
                                and unlimited group sessions. There are specific counseling sessions for varying groups,
                                such as women of color or LGBT students, specific walk-in times for students of color or
                                foreign-born students, and a collection of links to additional resources on campus,
                                according to its website. </p>
                            <p> Turner said she thinks ProtectUMD’s demand for an increase in these resources for
                                students of color would help those, like herself.</p>
                            <p> The Counseling Center declined to comment, but its website includes a <a
                                    href="http://www.counseling.umd.edu/cs/diversity/statement/" target="_blank"

                            <p> “We strive to provide services and programs that are inclusive and give voice to these
                                varied experiences by providing a safe place to be heard, appreciated and accepted…. Our
                                commitment to diversity is an ongoing and open-ended journey.”</p>
                            <p> “More kids just need help,” Turner said. “And there’s not enough people and not enough
                                time in the day.”</p>

                            <p>The University of Maryland supports underrepresented groups with a variety of
                                scholarships, including some focused on those in the STEM field, those pursuing Latinx
                                studies and female leaders on campus. </p>
                            <p> Despite these offerings, some students such as freshman computer engineering major,
                                Zaakira Ahmed, agree with the ProtectUMD demand that the university offer more
                                scholarships for students in marginalized communities. </p>
                            <p> “I came here and I didn’t get any scholarships and I didn’t get any financial aid
                                either,” Ahmed, a Muslim student, said. “I think that definitely for people of like
                                Muslim identity, and minorities in general, there should be more. Rather than academic
                                scholarships, there should be more scholarships available for marginalized communities.”
                            </p>
                            <p> Karla Casique, a junior journalism major with indigenous roots from Venezuela, said a
                                specific indigenous scholarship for incoming students, as demanded by ProtectUMD, could
                                help people adapt to an environment where they may feel secluded.</p>
                            <p> “UMD prides itself on diversity and inclusion, but when you come to UMD, it’s really
                                difficult to find,” she said. “Having a scholarship for high school indigenous students
                                would provide that support and vision to pursue the careers that they want, and I think
                                that it will further empower students that think it’s not possible.”</p>
                            <p> Freshman Misha Bucknor, a kinesiology major, said she thinks the university is doing a
                                “good job” compared to other schools in terms of providing a range of scholarships, but
                                “they could definitely do better; there’s always room for improvement.” </p>
                            <p> Bucknor, who is African-American, also emphasized the importance of these scholarships,
                                citing herself as an example. </p>
                            <p> “It’s definitely valid because a lot of marginalized people like communities, they have
                                come from a point where they’re being set back and it’s just like a chain reaction where
                                if someone’s parents haven’t been to college then their children probably won’t be able
                                to make it because they don’t have jobs that can provide them the funds to get there,”
                                Bucknor said. “Scholarships are one of the main things that are getting people here.”
                            </p>
                            <p> ProtectUMD is also asking the university to create merit scholarships and emergency
                                funds for undocumented and DACAmented students. "All of the scholarship requirements are
                                all U.S. citizen or permanent resident ... you can't ask like, 'what if you don't have
                                that,' while at the same time revealing your status," said an undocumented student who
                                is here under DACA. </p>

                                students of color on the campus and cited his annual State of the Campus Address on Dec.
                                6. </p>
                            <p> In his speech, Loh reaffirmed his November promise to protect undocumented students at
                                the university. He said the university will not share student information or grant
                                access to campus buildings to immigration enforcement officials unless they have a
                                warrant. He also said that the University Police would not partner with such officials
                                to help with enforcement.</p>
                            <p> "These are the things that we will commit to, that we will do and will not do in order
                                to create a safe and supportive learning environment," he said. </p>
                            <p> But for students involved with the issues of undocumented students, Loh’s statement was
                                already assumed, Fuentes said. </p>
                            <p> “For him to say, ‘I wouldn’t let [Immigration and Customs Enforcement] come onto campus
                                unless they have a warrant,’ is kind of useless, because if ICE were seeking to come on
                                to campus, it’s because they have a warrant,” she said. </p>
                            <p> “I think the biggest worry on the minds of undocumented students right now is, ‘If I’m
                                walking to class or if I’m in my dorm and ICE gets the address to my dorm, am I even
                                safe in my dorm,’” Fuentes said. “And the statements that President Loh has made so far
                                doesn’t really assure anyone that they’re safe in their dorm.”</p>

                            <p> ProtectUMD is demanding “the immediate response to hate speech and actions from the
                                university” and the “immediate turnaround for the removal of hate speech” on campus
                                property. </p>
                            <p> However, drawing the line between what is considered OK — and thus protected under the
                                First Amendment — and what is not, is a “slippery slope,” said Michael Spivey, a
                                constitutional law professor at this university. </p>
                            <p> “And with respect to hate speech, it’s very difficult to draw that line,” Spivey said.
                                “Once we start down that road, now a whole lot of speech that is not the ‘obvious’ hate
                                speech is going to now expand to simply folks who express opinions that are unpopular.”
                            </p>
                            <p> Billings, who said he is now afraid to walk home at night, said he understands First
                                Amendment concerns surrounding free speech, but the university should have strict
                                punishments for hate speech that might incite violence.</p>
                            <p> “There is a certain way you express how you feel,” he said. “You don’t up and draw
                                swastikas or say, ‘Heil Trump, build a wall, send every n-word to Africa and kill all
                                the faggots,’ and that stuff. That’s not what you’re supposed to do.”</p>
                            <p> After a racist, sexist email from a former Kappa Sigma fraternity member resurfaced and

                                    target="_blank" class="red">the University Senate shot down the bill</a> because it
                                conflicted with the First Amendment, which generally protects hate speech. </p>
                            <p> While hate speech is protected by the Constitution, actions that interfere with one’s
                                well-being are not, Spivey said. </p>
                            <p> “You can’t go around threatening people,” he said. “There’s a point at which speech goes
                                from being generalized and being protected, to being particularized and a threat to
                                another human being. The line is not exactly clear, but there is a line there and you
                                can’t do the latter.” </p>

                                university’s general education program catalog.</p>
                            <p> The classes meeting this requirement range in subject from the Fundamentals of Sign
                                Language to Intergroup Dialogue courses focusing on a particular marginalized group.

                                the classes meeting the requirement are too vague. </p>
                            <p> “The fact is that there is a diversity requirement and yet students still don’t know how
                                to address issues of diversity,” said the senior government and politics major. </p>
                            <p> ProtectUMD is asking for a “revamping” of this requirement because it’s important for
                                these types of classes to consider concepts such as oppression and privilege, Fuentes
                                said. </p>
                            <p> “You can have a class classify as diversity and have it be like an Ancient Asian
                                Literature class, and that would be diversity, but it’s not really assumed that you’d be
                                talking about oppression and your privilege and how that plays into your interactions
                                with others,” she said. </p>

                            <p> Sociology professor Rashawn Ray said a study like that would be beneficial. </p>
                            <p> "Collecting and analyzing data and creating more transparency is always important,” Ray
                                wrote in an email. “Students have a simple request, which includes having data on the
                                social interactions that students have with campus police and authority.” </p>
                            <p> Ray said students appear to be responding more broadly to the lack of national data on
                                police killings. </p>
                            <p> “The U.S. knows how many people catch the flu each year, but we do not know how many
                                people have police contact and get killed by the police each year,” he said. </p>

                            </p>
                            <p> He presented FBI data that shows black people are more likely to be killed by police
                                compared to whites and Hispanics/Latinos. Black people are also more likely than whites
                                to not ambush the police officers during these encounters. </p>
                            <p> “The legal system is rife with discrimination against minorities,” the demand reads,

                            <p>When asked about establishing voluntary accreditation for activist groups, senior Sajjad
                                Soltan said it would make certain groups feel more secure.</p>
                            <p> “So this kind of demand makes sense because it will make us feel safer, make us feel
                                more respected in our opinions, without having to give information about ourselves and
                                letting our opinions stand for themselves,” said Soltan, the vice president for Justice
                                in Palestine at this university. </p>
                            <p> When a student is in an activist group, they’re put under a spotlight, Soltan said. This
                                is especially true for pro-Palestine groups, Soltan added. </p>

                            <p>ProtectUMD demanded that administration should support and defend activist groups by
                                nullifying slander and smear campaigns from bigger groups or organizations. Protection
                                would be given in some cases such as in April, when members of Students for Justice in
                                Palestine, protested Israel Fest, JSU’s annual event celebrating Israeli culture, on
                                McKeldin Mall last spring. </p>
                            <p> As a result, Laila Abujuma, sophomore biology and nutritional science major said she and
                                a handful of other SJP members have been called terrorists, anti-Semitic and violent by
                                the Canary Mission, a website that compiles information on college students and
                                professors it deems to promote hatred of the United States, Israel and Jews. </p>
                            <p> This scares Abujuma as she moves forward in college, and the demand for increased
                                support to nullify slander would “provide a little bit more protection for students and
                                also give [more] comfort,” to students who are afraid of speaking for what they believe
                                in. </p>
                            <p> “If you search my name, it’s literally the first thing that comes up,” Abujuma said.
                                “And if someone truly believes it, that’s not going to be good for me either, so it
                                makes me scared to speak out against what I believe in and it makes me scared to fight
                                for the causes … because of things like this. But I guess I realize that’s the price of
                                activism.” </p>
                            <p> In situations like this, Abujuma said she and those affected have felt helpless. </p>
                            <p> “The thing about this whole situation is we can’t talk to administration or anyone about
                                it because there’s really nothing that they can do. There’s nothing that says you have
                                to protect students from being slandered for their rights or what they believe in,” she
                                said. We’re all just kind of in this place where we honestly can’t do anything about
                                it.” </p>
                            <p> The coalition also demanded this university “[m]ake free legal advice available for
                                students participating in activism who face slander or other dishonest claims while
                                exercising their rights to protest and free speech.” </p>
                            <p> The Student Legal Aid Office would not be able to assist a student who is in a conflict
                                with the university, but can provide advice on free speech, said Syndy Shilling, the
                                office’s director. </p>
                            <p> “If it is a general issue of advising them on their free speech rights or any of their
                                first amendment rights, certainly we can advise them,” Shilling said. </p>

                            <p>None of the University of Maryland’s Jewish student groups or organizations signed on to
                                ProtectUMD’s list of demands. </p>
                            <p> ProtectUMD issued a statement to The Diamondback explaining why no Jewish groups were
                                represented: </p>
                            <p> “ProtectUMD is a coalition of organizations throughout the University of Maryland’s
                                campus dedicated to uniting the different voices into one voice for change. When the
                                coalition was created, multiple organizations were contacted to participate while others
                                contacted us themselves. Not all organizations chose to be a part of the coalition.
                                ProtectUMD respects this choice. No one organization is in charge of the coalition and
                                as such, the purpose of ProtectUMD is not to prioritize demands but uplift the needs of
                                all marginalized communities. As a result of this, we did not turn away any communities
                                that wished to stand with us. </p>
                            <p> In regards to the discrepancy with JStreet, the organization did decline the invitation
                                to join ProtectUMD due to their disagreement with a demand previously submitted. This
                                does not mean that ProtectUMD does not support their issues or want their personal
                                demands responded to. Again, the coalition does not prioritize demands submitted and is
                                not an exclusionary organization. Our aim is for all marginalized communities on the UMD
                                campus to feel at home, safe, and protected.” </p>
                            <p> In response to the Pro-Palestinian student communities' set of demands, the following
                                student leaders agreed to comment on behalf of their organizations: Sam Koralnik of
                                Terps for Israel, Sam Fishman of the Jewish Student Union, Ethan Weisbaum of J Street U,
                                and Miranda Mlilo of Students for Justice in Palestine. </p>
                            <p> The students offered opinions about the absence of the Jewish voice within the demands
                                and weighed in on their groups’ stances toward Israel Fest and the BDS Movement. The
                                demand list calls for the university to encourage discussion about “the Palestinians’
                                struggles and the Boycott Divest and Sanction movement without fear of consequences by
                                the university administration.” </p>
                            <p> The BDS Movement calls for boycott, divestment and sanctioning of the State of Israel as
                                a “response of solidarity with the Palestinian struggle for freedom, justice and
                                equality,” according to its website. Some argue that the movement’s tactics parallel
                                those of the South African Anti-Apartheid movement of the 1980s. </p>
                            <p> It’s been a divisive issue for universities nationwide. During the 2014-15 school year,
                                19 campuses voted on BDS resolutions, though none were likely to impact university
                                policy, according to the Anti-Defamation League. The ADL is committed to fighting the
                                movement. </p>
                            <p> “The delegitimization of Israel is at the heart of contemporary anti-Semitism,” the ADL
                                states on its website. “BDS is one of its most visible and dangerous manifestations.”

                                incentivizing students to pick up more hours if they have an on-campus job,” he said.
                                “And if they can’t make ends meet with that on-campus job, they have to pick up a second
                                job off campus. It’s the exact opposite of what we should be doing if we look at this
                                from an academic perspective.” </p>
                            <p> For Billings, the lower wages combined with his shortened number of work hours has put
                                an even greater strain on his financial situation. Now, he said, he can’t afford to miss
                                any days just to get by.</p>
                            <p> “Working 20 hours a week and making $9 an hour — that’s not really adding up, especially
                                for people who live off campus,” he said. “That’s really unfair.” </p>

                                Office of Civil Rights & Sexual Misconduct at The University of Maryland.” </p>
                            <p> “I believe the University is working on meeting the demand,” Carroll wrote in an email.
                                “I don't have any other comment.” </p>
                            <p> Brianna Hill, a senior kinesiology major, said she once went into the office when it was
                                located in the Armory to speak on behalf of her friend. She said it is important to have
                                a permanent location that is welcoming to students so they feel comfortable coming
                                forward during moments of trauma. </p>
                            <p> “Having a permanent location and staff that are understanding would be a huge step,”
                                Hill said. “With a lot of the civil rights and sexual cases that are involved, not a lot
                                of people are comfortable coming up and speaking about it because of the weight that it
                                has.” </p>

                            <p>From a young age, Lilia Hinojosa, a senior theatre major, remembers learning about
                                Christopher Columbus, the man purported to discover America, she said. </p>
                            <p> But Hinojosa, whose father has indigenous roots from New Mexico, soon became confused by
                                the holiday in honor of Columbus. </p>
                            <p> “As I got older, I saw there wasn’t anything they were telling us about him that was
                                good or interesting,” she said. “It just seemed like the continuation of a holiday that
                                didn’t even mean anything.”</p>
                            <p> Columbus Day is still listed as a holiday on this university's calendar and it perplexes
                                Hinojosa to this day. </p>
                            <p> “It, a) makes it seem like they don’t care, and, b) is sort of a slap in the face
                                because we are here celebrating a man who ‘discovered’ America but it wasn’t discovered
                                – people lived here already,” she said. Columbus’ arrival catalyzed the raping,
                                pillaging and killing of indigenous people, and Hinojosa said “having Christopher
                                Columbus Day makes it seem like you are saying it is okay.” </p>
                            <p> ProtectUMD is seeking to change references to Columbus Day to Indigenous Peoples’ Day on
                                all university calendars. Hinojosa believes this is long overdue, as it would promote
                                better awareness and understanding of indigenous culture. </p>

                            <p>When giving talks, acknowledgment of standing on indigenous land is something James
                                Maffie, a university philosophy professor, remembers to mention each time.</p>
                            <p> ProtectUMD demanded the acknowledgement during every event that “this is indigenous
                                land,” and for speakers to make “efforts to officially recognize the tribe or nation
                                whose land upon which the University of Maryland is built.</p>
                            <p> “People can do this, whether or not people are willing to do it ... is another matter,”
                                Maffie said. “The university is basically built on stolen land and this is one way of
                                just acknowledging that … this country was built in a settler and colonial state and
                                this university part of that settler, colonialism.” </p>

                            <p>When Karla Casique, a junior journalism major, arrived at this university, she realized
                                the indigenous community “was very small and didn’t have a representation.” There are
                                currently 45 university students and 25 university employees who identify as American
                                Indian or Alaska Native, according to data from The Office of Institutional Research,
                                Planning, and Assessment.</p>
                            <p> Now Casique, the president of the American Indian Student Union who has indigenous
                                heritage from Venezuela, is pushing for an indigenous studies minor at this university.
                                This is also one of the demands ProtectUMD issued this semester. </p>
                            <p> Casique said there is currently a handful of classes offered at this university that
                                deal with indigenous cultures — but said she enrolled in one of those classes and found
                                herself let down due to the “sort of racist” way it was conducted. </p>
                            <p> “I was really disappointed because a lot of people I know who are Native American ended
                                up leaving because they felt that they were being tokenized,” she said. “So that pushed
                                me to reach out even more to other professors who were interested or were already having
                                these classes.”</p>
                            <p> Having an indigenous studies minor at this university is vital, she said, because it
                                would help raise awareness of the issues that indigenous people still face today. </p>
                            <p> “In 2016 we still have the Washington football name, the Dakota Access Pipeline has
                                opened up that huge history that indigenous people have gone through, like environmental
                                racism and police brutality,” she said, “so I think it would make a huge impact on UMD
                                and beyond because people would carry on their knowledge elsewhere in whatever career or
                                field they would go into.” </p>

                            <p> Increased funds, as ProtectUMD demanded, would give the groups more resources to “push

                            <p> The Sarah Winnemucca Award, named after a Paiute activist and author who advocated for
                                the rights of indigenous people, was awarded to Karla Casique, a junior journalism
                                major, during the 2015-16 academic year. </p>
                            <p> The award, however, is only recognized by Office of Multicultural Involvement and
                                Community Advocacy, and not by the university at large in its own list of awards,
                                Casique said, and ProtectUMD has demanded for that to change. </p>
                            <p> The award is presented to a student that has done significant work advocating for the
                                needs of the indigenous and native communities. Lilia Hinojosa, a senior theatre major,
                                said expanding the scope and visibility of that award would go a long way toward further
                                embracing the indigenous community on this campus — especially women, who Casique said
                                they want to give the award to. </p>
                            <p> “It’s important we recognize these accomplishments, specifically as native women,
                                because we don’t get a lot of recognition,” Hinojosa said. “Basically the only thing we
                                have is Pocahontas and that’s not accurate, so having something like this, it allows for
                                women to feel that their voice does matter and has an impact.”</p>

                                students. </p>
                            <p> Karla Casique, a junior multiplatform journalism student, said this is something that
                                could help people adapt to an environment where they may feel secluded.</p>
                            <p> “When they come to UMD, hopefully the presence of indigenous students or an indigenous
                                community will be visible in College Park, and they won’t feel as isolated or as
                                underrepresented,” she said.</p>
                            <p> The community aspect would be a major benefit, Casique noted, but it would have a more
                                long-term impact on students who are looking to further their education.</p>
                            <p> “UMD prides itself on diversity and inclusion, but when you come to UMD, it’s really
                                difficult to find,” she said. “Having a scholarship for high school indigenous students
                                would provide that support and vision to pursue the careers that they want, and I think
                                that it will further empower students that think it’s not possible.”</p>

                                challenging to find other people within the native community. </p>
                            <p> “It’s hard coming into a university that prides itself on diversity and then you have to
                                scavenge through everything to find even a grain of your culture,” she said. “That’s
                                obviously really hard as a student because you have to pick and choose what types of
                                identity you are going to be a part of or be involved in.” </p>
                            <p> The construction of an indigenous cultural center — one of the ProtectUMD demands —
                                would help solve that problem, Casique said. </p>
                            <p> An indigenous cultural center on the campus would make it easier for students to explore
                                their identity by hosting certain cultural events and participating in rituals like
                                burning sweetgrass or sage before meetings — something that proves challenging in other
                                buildings because it is technically prohibited as it involves lighting something on
                                fire, Casique said. </p>
                            <p> “It’s really sad because it is a cultural practice and to some people it is a religious
                                practice as well,” Casique said. “If we had a cultural center, with those type of things
                                hopefully we will have an opening to do and we will not feel uncomfortable or weird
                                doing those practices.” </p>

                            <p>When the Yanet Amanuel read Michelle Alexander’s The New Jim Crow: Mass Incarceration in
                                the Age of Colorblindness her sophomore year, she was first introduced to the idea of
                                the prison industrial complex. Her research led to her a discovery: Prison labor has far
                                reaching effects, right down to the table and chairs in all University of Maryland
                                classrooms and libraries. </p>
                            <p> “We talk about slavery and how horrible it was, but it’s still happening,” said the
                                senior sociology major. “If we’re going to stand for one thing that is wrong, I believe
                                we have to stand for all things that are wrong.” </p>
                            <p> ProtectUMD is demanding the university divest from Maryland Correctional Enterprises,
                                the prison industry arm for the state’s correctional facilities. MCE has worked with
                                this university for more than 30 years, and they sold about $3.5 million worth of
                                furniture to the campus in 2014, <a
                                    href="http://www.dbknews.com/archives/article_1c3defd0-f1db-11e4-9775-b7dfa005d178.html"
                                    class="red" target="_blank">The Diamondback previously reported. </a></p>
                            <p> A Maryland statute requires the university system to purchase its furniture from
                                Maryland Correctional Enterprises. </p>
                            <p> As a result, the system “is not in a position to come out and say, ‘You know, we’re
                                going to divest or do things differently’,” said system spokesman Mike Lurie. “It’s just
                                not an option,” Lurie said. Thomas Hickey, director of procurement and real property
                                initiatives for the university system, said the goal of the training is to give inmates
                                job skills that they can use to market themselves when they get out of prison. He said
                                he knows some students feel like MCE exploits prisoners, but he disagrees with their
                                assessment. </p>
                            <p> “If you actually talk to some of the inmates and ask them what they thought about it, I
                                think you might hear something different,” Hickey said. </p>
                            <p> But Amanuel said the truth about MCE is not so sunny. Inmates work full days for far
                                less than minimum wage, and most people never look into the system, she said. </p>
                            <p> “The issue is — is it really rehabilitating or just exploiting?” Amanuel said. </p>
                            <p> Despite the state statute, Amanuel believes there are steps the university should take
                                now. </p>
                            <p> Amanuel believes the university should start the conversation by first acknowledging
                                that MCE is a supplier and put out a statement saying they’d like to divest. Then, the
                                school could begin to cut ties with other businesses that buy from MCE. </p>
                            <p> “Once you start economically affecting businesses associated they no longer want to be
                                invested in it and that makes the state really think, ‘Is this really worth it if these
                                businesses don’t want to buy?’“ Amanuel said. </p>
                            <p> Total divestment could take years, but Amanuel said she will stick around for the fight.
                                After graduation, she plans to stay in the area to help the students who fill her shoes
                                at the university. </p>
                            <p> Although the ProtectUMD coalition says it does not prioritize demands, Amanuel said they
                                are working to create a timeline for those that will take longer, and to find
                                intermediate steps in between. In the case of MCE, possibilities include paying inmates
                                higher wages or offering education programs to subsidize their work. </p>
                            <p> But Amanuel says that won’t solve the root of the problem. </p>
                            <p> “Ultimately the movement needs to be to completely divest,” she said. “And that will
                                have to do with the state of Maryland.” </p>
                            <p> If students wanted to continue pursuing system divestment from MCE, they would have to
                                work with the Maryland General Assembly to change the current State Finance and
                                Procurement Article, Lurie and Hickey said. </p>

                                took the megaphone to tell people about Maryland Correctional Enterprises, a state-run
                                business that employs prisoners for less than minimum wage. The sociology major said
                                after the rally was over, interest in the issue grew. </p>
                            <p> “I had a lot of students who either did not know about this or wanted to know what
                                businesses they should disassociate themselves with,” she said. </p>
                            <p> ProtectUMD is calling for students to divest from companies that invest in the prison
                                industrial complex. </p>
                            <p> When it comes to changing Maryland’s prison labor industry, Amanuel said education is
                                the biggest barrier. </p>
                            <p> “The first step is raising awareness which is something we’re really working heavily on
                                this year so that next year is implementing action,” she said. </p>
                            <p> As the activism chair of Maryland’s NAACP chapter, Amanuel is putting together a town
                                hall event to teach students about the prison industrial complex and ways they can take
                                action against MCE. For starters, they can stop spending money at businesses that are
                                invested in prison labor, she said. </p>
                            <p> “Businesses are afraid of people boycotting because it hurts their business and that’s
                                the only time I feel like they’ll listen,” she said. </p>
                            <p> Amanuel said students often feel like a movement needs to be large before they get
                                involved, but she advises them not to wait for a leader. Students should do their own
                                research and make personal choices to divest from these businesses. </p>
                            <p> “It starts with one,” she said. “Before you could say you didn’t know, but once you know
                                it’s then up to you.” </p>

                            <p>Lauryn Froneberger, a senior journalism major who is also president of this university’s
                                NAACP chapter, said she has struggled to find role models in professors who also look
                                like her, as a black woman.</p>
                            <p> “In my experience, it’s been very hard to find a professor in my major that I can
                                connect with and relate to that is also tenured and I know will be around for a while,”

                            <p> Data on diversity in tenure and tenure-track faculty positions at this university showed
                                3 percent of professors were black in 2011 and 2 percent of current total professors are
                                black. In Froneberger’s case, the journalism college did not have a black professor in a
                                tenure or tenure track position as of spring 2016.</p>

                                new postdoctoral fellows, also from historically underrepresented groups. The Provost’s
                                Office will also start grooming them for tenure and tenure-track positions in the
                                future. </p>
                            <p> Froneberger said this funding does show the university prioritizing this issue and hopes
                                Loh can publicize these efforts further.</p>
                            <p> “I want him to make students more aware of it and try to involve students in the

                            <p>When senior Lauryn Froneberger toured the University of Maryland as a prospective
                                student, no one told her what that brick building next to Stamp Student Union was. </p>
                            <p> Once she committed to this university and came back for orientation, she said other
                                students were worried about finding out where they were going to eat and where they were
                                going to sleep.</p>
                            <p> But for Froneberger, the biggest concern was “where am I going to find a place that I
                                feel safe, where I can find a mentor?” </p>
                            <p> She brought this up with an orientation advisor, who told her that brick building was
                                the Nyumburu Cultural Center. She later learned Nyumburu housed groups like the Black
                                Student Union and this university’s chapter of the NAACP, among other resources that
                                would help her feel comfortable as a black student on a predominantly white campus. </p>
                            <p> ProtectUMD is demanding Nyumburu be a required stop during campus tours. </p>
                            <p> “They don’t just celebrate our black culture – it’s there for students across many
                                different communities. That’s what makes it so rich and so important,” Froneberger said.
                                “It will help with recruitment so much if people know there’s a place for them here.”
                            </p>
                            <p> A tour route manual from 2016 provided to The Diamondback instructs Images guides to
                                talk about Nyumburu while standing by the Frederick Douglass statue in Hornbake Plaza at
                                the end of the tour. </p>
                            <p> But Froneberger said she’s worried tour guides skip this step, or only devote a few
                                sentences to Nyumburu lumped along with the other topics they broach. This stop is also
                                where guides are told to talk about Hornbake Library, the career center and tell their
                                “Why I Came To Maryland” story, among other things. </p>
                            <p> ProtectUMD is also demanding “increased funding” for Nyumburu, though the group does not
                                specify how much. </p>
                            <p> Nyumburu had an operating budget of $635,765, according to the university’s fiscal 2016
                                operating budget for expenditures. Froneberger said it’s not enough. </p>
                            <p> “People wonder, will Nyumburu still be around when we have children and they come to
                                Maryland?” she said. “It’s a sacred place for us, students of color, to go and exist.”

                            <p>Senior Erica Fuentes said a Latinx cultural center is not a new request. </p>
                            <p> “When I was a freshman, I remember it was something that people were actively asking
                                administration for,” said Fuentes, the president of Political Latinxs United for
                                Movement and Action in Society. </p>
                            <p> Fuentes said this center would provide support to the campus’ more than 2,700 Latinx
                                students. </p>
                            <p> “It would a space where any Latinx student would be able to go to with any need that
                                they have or any issue that they’re dealing with and they would be able to find some
                                sort of resource there for that,” the government and politics major said. </p>
                            <p> These resources could include study space for commuters, counselors who understand the
                                needs of the community and a library with Hispanic and Latinx literature. Currently,
                                Fuentes said the closest thing to such a place is the Office of Multicultural
                                Involvement and Community Advocacy in Stamp Student Union. </p>
                            <p> “There’s only like one staff there that’s really trained to deal with the Latinx
                                community, and it’s a lot for only one staff member to have to deal with,” she said.
                            </p>
                            <p> Location is important, Fuentes said. Jimenez Hall has been a natural gathering place for
                                the community, she added, and there have been talks of renovating the basement into a
                                center, but the plans aren’t concrete. </p>
                            <p> “We’re still in the process of trying to partner of with faculty and staff members who
                                would be willing to help us in locating a place that would be feasible in housing a
                                cultural center,” she said. </p>

                                is mainly to reaffirm and strengthen values that are already present in parts of the
                                admission and orientation processes. </p>
                            <p> The senior journalism major has served as an orientation adviser for the orientation
                                office and remembers how her orientation experience helped her feel comfortable. </p>
                            <p> “There are several breakout sessions where you get to meet other students of color,” she
                                said. “Those are typically led by students of color and you are able to connect with
                                them and have friends and you walk in.” </p>
                            <p> Chelsea Truesdell, assistant director for the orientation office, wrote in an email that
                                orientation advisers did a skit this summer focused on diversity, inclusion and
                                expectations for students. </p>
                            <p> “Through this skit, we hope to showcase to new students that the expectation at UMD is
                                one of acceptance and inclusion,” Truesdell wrote. </p>
                            <p> Yet there are always opportunities for groups to increase their efforts around diversity
                                and inclusion, Froneberger said, noting the potential to bring in more diversity among
                                tour guides for Maryland Images. </p>
                            <p> “It’s a call on these groups to take an extra step to make sure students feel included,”

                            <p>Erica Fuentes, president of the Political Latinxs United for Movement and Action in
                                Society, said it’s difficult for many multicultural student organizations to obtain
                                funding since they often schedule their programming based on current events, making
                                their activities difficult to anticipate.</p>
                            <p> “With PLUMAS, we’ve had most of our programming since mid-semester around the election,
                                and obviously that wasn’t something we could have foreseen, and yet all of the deadlines
                                for funding have passed,” the senior government and politics major said.</p>
                            <p> Fuentes said this poses challenges for multicultural organizations university-wide.</p>
                            <p> “You see cultural organizations having to do their own fundraising, like bake sales and
                                things like that, which takes on added pressure and added time out of your
                                organization,” she said.</p>

                                that they can carry out cultural programming. </p>

                            <p> ProtectUMD is demanding the university train faculty in the “fundamentals of campus
                                inclusion of queer folks.”</p>
                            <p> LGBT Equity Center Director Luke Jensen said this demand is not realistic because
                                mandating faculty to undergo any sort of training is “very difficult."</p>
                            <p> "At current levels of resources, it’s simply not possible,” Jensen said. “Who would do
                                it?” </p>
                            <p> But the Equity Center does offer the Rainbow Terrapin Network Training, an event that
                                draws attention to how to approach the problems facing the LGBT community in a sensitive
                                way. </p>
                            <p> They plan to make this more widely available by moving it to an online platform. </p>
                            <p> “This coming semester, rather than in-person trainings, we’re going to be focused more
                                on webinars so that we can reach larger numbers of people,” Jensen said. </p>

                            <p>Anders Tighe has never lived on-campus at this university, but he remembers a “pretty
                                offensive” experience as a resident of a dorm at Calvin College in Michigan.</p>
                            <p> A male-identifying friend asked Tighe, who is transgender, if he would like to live with
                                him in a male dorm. But the school refused to allow Tighe, who was just starting hormone
                                therapy at the time, to room with his friend. </p>
                            <p> “The way they worked around it was by putting me in a female dorm with another trans
                                man,” the senior theatre major said. “That was a very solvable issue where I already had
                                somebody who was perfectly comfortable sharing a room with a trans person, and that was
                                still not accepted by the university.” </p>
                            <p> This university does allow mixed gender housing — meaning someone lives in a room with
                                someone of the same gender, but other rooms in the hall might have members of a
                                different gender — and gender-inclusive housing, which means students share a room with
                                others regardless of their sex, gender or gender identity. </p>
                            <p> But ProtectUMD’s list of demands includes allowing different gendered roommates through
                                random selection. Currently, the university does not allow random matching for
                                gender-inclusive housing, and instead requires students to have a mutual agreement
                                before rooming with each other. </p>
                            <p> Under current university policy, Tighe would not have experienced the problem he did at
                                Calvin College. But as someone who has experienced a different set of rules because of
                                his gender identity, he said he supports allowing random matching for gender inclusive
                                housing. </p>
                            <p> “I can understand why the administration would have reservations about that because I
                                can understand why there would be people who would try to abuse it — but I don’t care,”
                                he said. “The idea of someone trying to abuse it potentially doesn’t negate the fact it
                                would be extremely helpful and validating, especially for trans students.” </p>

                            <p>For Anders Tighe, a senior theatre major at this university, hunting for a gender-neutral
                                bathroom on this campus can be “really difficult.”</p>
                            <p> Tighe, who is transgender, said he avoids using gendered restrooms for fear of
                                encountering someone who might respond negatively. </p>
                            <p> “Personally, I only use gender-neutral bathrooms because I don’t want to deal with the
                                potential of there being a problematic person in a men’s bathroom, for example,” he
                                said. “I’ve definitely had situations where I’ve decided to not go to the bathroom and
                                have to pass five different bathrooms just to find a gender-neutral one.” </p>
                            <p> Currently, this university has 66 gender-neutral bathrooms throughout campus, according
                                to a list compiled by the LGBT Equity Center. These restrooms exist in <a
                                    href="http://thestamp.umd.edu/Portals/1/Documents/Gender_Neutral_Bathrooms.pdf"
                                    class="red" target="_blank">Stamp Student Union</a>, the Potomac Building and the
                                John S. Toll Physics Building, but not all buildings offer such accommodations. </p>
                            <p> Tighe supports ProtectUMD’s demand to change that. </p>
                            <p> “Maybe it feels like a small issue … Like, you don’t think, ‘Oh is somebody going to
                                confront me in the bathroom because of my gender identity?’ But those are things that
                                evidently do happen, as we have seen in recent legislation,” he said, referring to North
                                Carolina’s HB2, which would prevent transgender people from using bathrooms that align
                                with their gender identity. </p>
                            <p> Of the small number of gender-inclusive bathrooms on the campus, even fewer are
                                multi-stall – something else ProtectUMD wants to see change. </p>
                            <p> Remi Liang, who identifies as genderqueer, meaning their gender identity does not fall
                                inside the presumed male-female binary, said ProtectUMD’s demand for pushing for
                                multi-stall gender inclusive bathrooms in every building would be a great aid for for
                                nonbinary students on the campus, Liang said, as it would foster a more inclusive
                                academic setting. </p>
                            <p> “It’s important to have [gender neutral] bathrooms because who wants to hold it when in
                                class?” they said. “It makes it hard to concentrate and it’s annoying. It makes you miss
                                classes as well.” </p>
                            <p> Starting in fall 2014, Facilities Management has put gender neutral and family restrooms
                                on <a

                            <p>Brianna Hill, a senior kinesiology major who identifies as bisexual, said LGBT studies
                                should expand from its program within the women’s studies department and become an
                                independent department, as demanded by ProtectUMD. </p>
                            <p> “It is a long time coming,” Hill said. “I think more people need to be educated in LGBT
                                studies in general.” </p>
                            <p> However, at this point it’s too early to tell how feasible making the LGBT studies
                                program into a department is, said Robyn Muncy, the interim chair of the women’s studies
                                department, which offers the LGBT studies certificate and minor. </p>
                            <p> Muncy said with a separate department, there might be too much overlap in course
                                curricula. </p>
                            <p> “I would think that there would be a lot of duplication in the [women’s] studies
                                department, the way this one [the women’s studies department] wants to be a site of
                                intersectional analysis and activism and LGBT [issues] — presumably doing the same thing
                                [that an LGBT studies department would],” she said. </p>
                            <p> As a one-time member of Theta Pi Sigma, a gender-neutral “frarority” on the campus, Hill
                                said she learned about the needs of people within the LGBT community — and specifically
                                the transgender community, which she said would benefit from improved LGBT studies. </p>
                            <p> “There needs to be more [outreach] to and education about this community,” Hill said.
                                “Because I feel safe, I feel fine, but they don’t feel safe and they don’t feel fine.”
                            </p>
                            <p> Muncy said she would want the opportunity to speak with ProtectUMD to hear student
                                concerns about the LGBT studies program. </p>
                            <p> “We would just like to see what is it that they think would be better for them and for
                                the study of LGBTQ study and issues if it were an independent department,” Muncy said.

                            <p>Rad Adler said he supports ProtectUMD’s demand to replace gendered checkboxes on all
                                university forms, surveys and applications. </p>
                            <p> “At the University of Maryland, which is an incredibly liberal place — I mean just so
                                completely a total paradise compared to the rest of the country, other than farther up
                                north — I think that’s a thing we can do here,” Adler, who is transgender, said. “So,
                                why not? We should do it. And yeah, I don’t think it would hurt anyone.” </p>
                            <p> Some organizations, such as the Counseling Center, offer gendered options outside the
                                male-female binary on surveys, said Luke Jensen, director of the LGBT Equity Center.
                            </p>
                            <p> “There is no university-wide ability to designate anything other than male or female,”
                                Jensen wrote in an email, “but some departments may ask in a way that provides more
                                options.” </p>
                            <p> The demand from ProtectUMD, however, would presumably do away with any gendered options
                                at all, leaving just a blank space to fill in. Adler concedes he has some concerns about
                                that idea. </p>
                            <p> The policy “has the potential of outing people who don’t necessarily want to be outed,”
                                Adler said. With the open space, he explained, a student may want “to be transparent
                                about how they identify but maybe doesn’t feel safe doing so.” </p>

                            <p> But the community was open and learned from Adler’s experience, he said. Now, he
                                considers his professors allies. </p>
                            <p> “I couldn’t have asked for a better welcome,” said Adler, who is not enrolled in classes
                                this semester, but will be returning next semester after taking time off to recuperate
                                from his transition. “I feel like a prodigal son returning home.” </p>
                            <p> ProtectUMD’s demand for more support for arts and humanities has been echoed by students
                                like Adler, who have built support systems and learned skills they could not have in
                                other departments, they said. </p>
                            <p> “The arts ... especially, the performing arts, they teach you that your person has
                                value,” said Christopher Walkup, a senior government and politics and theatre major.
                                “You are worth getting up on stage. Your work should be viewed.” </p>
                            <p> Enrollment is down in the arts and humanities college, which houses 28 majors and 31
                                minors and receives the third highest allocation in fiscal 2016 operating budget of this
                                university’s 11 colleges. </p>
                            <p> University data show a more than 30 percent decrease in enrollment in the arts and
                                humanities college since fall 2010. In the English major alone, enrollment declined 40
                                percent from 2012 to 2015. </p>
                            <p> At the same time, students have enrolled in STEM-related majors at record rates.
                                Enrollment has grown by more than 32 percent in the math and natural sciences college
                                and more than 26 percent in the engineering college since fall 2010. </p>
                            <p> Arts and humanities lost visibility in 2012 when this university switched from CORE, a
                                set of general education requirements in effect since 1990, to Gen Ed, a more expansive
                                updated general education track. CORE required nine credits in the arts and humanities —
                                with at least three in literature and three in arts — but Gen Ed requires only six and
                                has specified no subject areas. </p>
                            <p> While the university has taken steps to develop arts partnerships, such as with The
                                Phillips Collection, some students feel humanities often take a backseat to STEM
                                subjects and athletics. </p>
                            <p> While she said she understands the importance of both, junior elementary education
                                Michelle Joseph emphasized humanistic education in post-election America. </p>
                            <p> “In order to really compromise and move forward, especially when people have such very
                                strong ideas, to be open to reexamining your ideas ... I think the arts and humanities
                                really help,” she said. “If we can’t get that down, hopes of compromise and moving
                                forward are null and void.” </p>

                            <p>During his campaign, Donald Trump used the idea of a Muslim registry to win favor with
                                voters. </p>
                            <p> "I would certainly implement that. Absolutely," he said last November, when an MSNBC
                                reporter asked him if his White House would like to create a Muslim registry program.
                            </p>
                            <p> The president-elect immediately took to Twitter to revoke his statement, but his
                                indecisiveness about the plan has since made some members of this university’s Muslim
                                community nervous.</p>
                            <p> “The university has the information about us,” said junior math and philosophy major
                                Sarah Eshera, who is Muslim. </p>
                            <p> Although the campus is a member of the University System of Maryland and is
                                government-funded, Eshera still believes this university can take action to protect
                                Muslim students if Trump acts on his campaign promise. </p>
                            <p> “It would still … provide a sense of safety if we knew the university wasn't the one
                                giving the government that information about us,” she said. “And feeling like our
                                administration is protecting us and willing to do that carries some value.” </p>

                            <p>Because of junior Sarah Eshera’s busy class schedule, the Muslim student has a hard time
                                finding a few moments and a convenient space to pray.</p>
                            <p> “A lot of times what students do is if they have a situation like that -- they’ll pray
                                in a stairwell or a corner which is fine, but in that situation you’re not really
                                focusing on your prayer,” the math and philosophy major said. </p>
                            <p> Her classes are in the Skinner Building, where she says it’s hard to find even a
                                stairwell, let alone run back to the one designated prayer room, or Musallah, located in
                                Cole Field House. One of the five pillars of Islam states that Muslims must pray five
                                times a day. </p>
                            <p> “I never have time to go there and pray, so I end up having to pray two of my prayers
                                together,” she said. “If [students] want a quiet area where they can focus on their
                                prayer and they don’t want to delay their prayer, then they should be afforded that.”
                            </p>
                            <p> Among the list of ProtectUMD demands was that one room in each major building, such as
                                the School of Public Health, the chemistry building and McKeldin, be designated for
                                prayer. </p>
                            <p> Government and politics lecturer Michael Spivey said it is legal for a public university
                                to provide prayer space as long as members of all religions have equal access, according
                                to the Equal Access Act, which declares public secondary schools receiving federal
                                funding and allowing students to use space outside of school hours for extracurricular
                                activities must allow equal access to all students. </p>
                            <p> As long as members of all religions are welcome in that room, it’s unlikely to be
                                considered unconstitutional, Spivey said. </p>
                            <p> Director of the Department of Facilities Planning Brenda Testa indicated that
                                reallocating space might be the issue. </p>
                            <p> “It would come at the cost of providing that space by taking it away or reallocating it
                                from some other purpose,” Testa said. “In most of our buildings there’s not a square
                                foot of real estate that is sitting around waiting around for another use. That’s a bit
                                of a generalization, but we have a significant space shortage here.” </p>
                            <p> Eshera said the space doesn’t need many frills, just open space for kneeling. The
                                classroom could be used for lectures at other times and students of any faith would be
                                invited to pray there when it’s designated for that purpose. </p>
                            <p> “It could honestly be used for any religion,” she said. “Like if any Christian student
                                wanted somewhere to pray before class, they could use it for that too. It wouldn't be
                                exclusive to just Muslims.” </p>

                            <p> For MSA’s hundreds of members, that can be a problem. </p>
                            <p> “We substitute the lack of an actual building by renting out or getting spaces within

                            <p> Last year, the environmental science and technology major thought of a solution that
                                would allow members of the Muslim community to come together for events and prayer: a
                                shuttle bus to the Diyanet Center of America. Supported by the Turkish government, the
                                center is about 15 minutes away from campus in Lanham. There, the local Muslim community
                                gathers for Friday prayers as well as dinners and other cultural events. MSA members
                                sometimes participate in these events and use the center’s recreational facilities, but
                                Ingram says transportation makes it difficult. Students often carpool. </p>
                            <p> “We have to ask who’s available right now and start driving back and forth,” he said.
                            </p>
                            <p> David Allen, the executive director of the Department of Transportation, said he hadn’t
                                heard of this need before, but DOTS is “happy to work with students to meet their
                                needs.” </p>
                            <p> Allen says adding stops to pre-existing bus routes makes the most sense. Ingram has
                                already thought of that. His came up with a route that involved making the Diyanet
                                Center a stop on the old NASA Goddard shuttle route. </p>
                            <p> “It was supposed to be six minutes extra on the route, but they canceled the route
                                entirely,” he said. “So the feasibility of it might be a bit less than what it was in
                                the past.” </p>
                            <p> It all comes down to the budget, Allen said. </p>
                            <p> “To increase service we would have to cut something or stay within the constraints of
                                the current shuttle budget,” he says. </p>
                            <p> Ingram said there may be other options. He envisions a more private service like
                                Nightride that could take students to the center one evening a week. </p>
                            <p> “It doesn't have to be a continuous service,” he said. </p>

                            <p>Senior English major Aiyah Sibay said that even on “a campus that prides itself on
                                diversity,” misperceptions about Islam and Muslim people are common. </p>
                            <p> Sibay said her father, who is Muslim and wears a religious cap, has repeatedly had
                                people call the cops to report him as a suspicious person. </p>
                            <p> ProtectUMD is calling for “increased discussions about the diversity of the Muslim
                                community on campus and worldwide.” </p>
                            <p> In the media, Sibay said, Islam is consistently associated with terrorism, and many
                                Americans don’t learn anything else about the religion or its people. </p>
                            <p> The dehumanizes and decharacterizes Muslims, she said, adding that more must be done to
                                “put a face to this ... otherwise faceless mass.” </p>
                            <p> More education and discussion would provide a “different, more honest vision of our
                                religion and our region,” Sibay said. </p>

                            <p>Behind the demand for more classes pertaining to Muslim culture is senior Aiyah Sibay.
                                But the English major said she’s not necessarily pushing for more classes, so much as a
                                different type of learning. </p>
                            <p> “[On] this campus, we do have classes on Islam, we do have classes on politics in the
                                region,” she said. </p>
                            <p> Sibay said the classes this university offers tend to focus on conflict and war in the
                                Islamic world, while ignoring the artistic and cultural contributions of Arab and
                                Persian people. </p>
                            <p> “We need to change the way we’re being introduced to these regions,” she said. “We don’t
                                have any classes in the English department that study the literature of a region that’s
                                so rich for its literature [and] rich for its art.” </p>
                            <p> For Sibay, the significance is personal. Although she was born in the U.S., Sibay
                                identifies with her Syrian heritage, and it fuels her to advocate for her religion and
                                culture. </p>
                            <p> “What happened in my country in 2011 put a lot of anger,” she said. “A lot of my
                                activism comes from a place of anger.” </p>
                            <p> To begin raising awareness for her cause, Sibay formed the Kahwa wa Kutub literary group
                                to study Middle Eastern and North African works of art and literature. Sibay isn't sure
                                her club will last after her graduation, so she's hoping for a class as a more permanent
                                place for students to learn about these topics. </p>
                            <p> “Trust me,” she said. “Just one class on Arabic literature or Persian literature changes
                                completely the way that people think about the region." </p>

                            <p>Two of the demands from the ProtectUMD campaign can be traced directly back to April
                                2015, when one movie spurred a passionate, at times vitriolic debate at this university
                                that touched on issues of Islamophobia, free speech and the politicization of art. </p>
                            <p> That spring, Student Entertainment Events made a late change in its lineup of free movie
                                screenings for students, choosing to replace Jupiter Ascending with American Sniper
                                because of the former film’s box office and critical failure. </p>
                            <p> This decision was met with backlash, and within days of its announcement, a Change.org
                                petition demanding SEE pull the movie had gained traction online. The Muslim Students
                                Association, one of several student groups that voiced concerns against the movie,
                                sponsored the petition. </p>
                            <p> The petition stated that the film “dehumanizes Muslim individuals, promotes the idea of
                                senseless mass murder, and portrays negative and inaccurate stereotypes.” </p>
                            <p> Two weeks after the petition emerged, SEE decided to postpone the screening to the
                                following fall in hopes they could better plan an event that included a discussion
                                afterward to facilitate an open dialogue about the issues presented in the film. </p>
                            <p> The story went national, with Fox News and other outlets decrying the postponement as a
                                limit on free speech. The MSA received the brunt of the online anger, with anti-Islamic
                                messages and threats flooding their social media pages. While many of these comments
                                came from people who did not attend this university, some of the student body was
                                undoubtedly angry about SEE’s decision as well. </p>
                            <p> More than a year-and-a-half later, these two ProtectUMD demands are evidence that scars
                                from this dilemma still remain. The demands call to “prevent situations similar to the
                                “American Sniper” situation from happening again” and for SEE to “have better judgement
                                when choosing to show movies that perpetuate false narratives and stereotypes of
                                [Muslims].” </p>
                            <p> “In the wake of this event, I will say that, frankly, our cause for concern, our alarm
                                and awareness, has gone way up … There are fears, very real fears, in our community,”
                                university student Naeem Baig told The Diamondback in April 2015. At the time, Baig was
                                a sophomore finance and marketing major and served as The Muslim Student Association’s
                                public relations director. </p>
                            <p> Catalina Mejia, president of SEE, said she remembers the group being caught off guard in
                                2015 about the reaction the group received from both sides. Since the incident, SEE has
                                changed the way it deals with potentially controversial topics and events, especially
                                movie screenings. </p>
                            <p> “As an organization, after the American Sniper situation, we make sure we’re going above
                                and beyond what we thought we were already doing,” Mejia said. “We pride ourselves in
                                thinking about all types of diversity, not just racial diversity but also diversity in
                                thought.” </p>
                            <p> All event ideas now go through an extended proposal process, Mejia said, that involves
                                the SEE board discussing what potential issues the event could bring about, what student
                                groups might be affected in any way or how someone unfamiliar with SEE and their events
                                might perceive it. </p>
                            <p> “We want to make sure we’re being our own devil’s advocate in terms of how things could
                                be interpreted,” Mejia said. </p>
                            <p> Mejia and other SEE members stressed how open they are to all kinds of feedback about
                                their events, especially from students. They view it as the lifeblood of their
                                decision-making process. Mejia said she is confident that this fact, in addition to the
                                increasingly strict planning process they now employ, will make meeting this demand a
                                very real and highly likely possibility. </p>
                            <p> Khaled Nurhssien, a junior communication major and current MSA member, agreed both
                                demands could and should become a reality. </p>
                            <p> “I think [these demands] are ridiculously easy [to accomplish]. They’re very easy. All
                                it would take is consideration on the part of the SEE board,” he said. “It doesn’t even
                                have to be a longer process than they already have — it just requires that the person
                                who’s making decisions to keep in mind the effect of the movies he or she is choosing.
                                That’s all it requires.” </p>

                            <p> Sarwat Kazmi has a dining plan, but she’s gone months without using it. </p>
                            <p> “Because there seems to be such limited halal food options for Muslim students, it’s
                                just easier for me to bring food from home,” the sophomore government and politics major
                                said. </p>
                            <p> The term halal refers to the types of food, specifically meat, that has been prepared in
                                accordance with Muslim law. For the most part, Kazmi also adheres to zabihah standards,
                                which is a series of rules regarding the preparation of meat, including killing an
                                animal in a clean, respectful way. </p>
                            <p> “If it’s zabihah-halal, then it was slaughtered with the blessing that we say,” Kazmi
                                said. </p>
                            <p> Dining Services spokesman Bart Hipple said Dining Services does offer halal foods. </p>
                            <p> “All of our fresh chicken is halal certified, which they love,” he said. “We have
                                additional meat options that Chef John can purchase at the local halal store.” </p>
                            <p> But Kazmi said the process for getting halal meals isn’t convenient. Once a week, she
                                has to fill out a sheet for the coming days worth of meals. </p>
                            <p> “That was fine for the first couple weeks but I kind of grew tired of it,” she said. “It
                                was almost a chore to go there at a certain time when there’s so much going on already
                                this semester.” </p>
                            <p> Kazmi said she asked Dining Services for an exemption from the required meal plan for
                                students who live on campus but was turned down. Now, her mom brings her food that meets
                                both zabihah-halal standards and is safe for her food allergies. </p>
                            <p> “The dining options – they’re minimal in terms of what’s halal and what’s not,” Kazmi
                                said. </p>
                            <p> Dining Service’s nutritionist Sister Maureen Schrimpe says about 15 students have
                                requested halal meals this semester. </p>
                            <p> “We meet with them individually to discuss their many options that we have or can have,”
                                she said. </p>
                            <p> Kazmi understands the demand for zabihah food may be small, but she says there are other
                                solutions to make Muslim students’ lives easier. She said it would be helpful if
                                ingredients in dishes were labeled better. </p>
                            <p> “There’s been a couple times where I was eating mac and cheese and it turned out that
                                there was bacon in it,” she said. “I don’t eat pork so that’s a bit unnerving.” </p>
                            <p> Hipple said, "Not all of our meat [is halal], but we can give people an easy guide to
                                determine what [is].” </p>
                            <p> Even so, Kazmi says it’s not enough. </p>
                            <p> “For the most part, I will just go with vegetarian, just to be safe,” she said. </p>
                            <p> In an ideal world, Kazmi says, Muslim students could have something similar to the
                                Hillel meal plan, where Jewish students can eat specially prepared food in their own
                                dining hall. But if the need is not great enough, she said she’s fine with a revamping
                                of the current system. </p>

                                has amplified the anxieties of many Muslims on campus and nationwide, particularly those
                                who wear a hijab or cap that serves a visible mark of their religion, she added. </p>
                            <p> “I can’t imagine the fear that they’re walking around with,” Sibay said. </p>

                            <p>None of the University of Maryland’s Jewish student groups or organizations signed on to
                                ProtectUMD’s list of demands. </p>
                            <p> ProtectUMD issued a statement to The Diamondback explaining why no Jewish groups were
                                represented: </p>
                            <p> “ProtectUMD is a coalition of organizations throughout the University of Maryland’s
                                campus dedicated to uniting the different voices into one voice for change. When the
                                coalition was created, multiple organizations were contacted to participate while others
                                contacted us themselves. Not all organizations chose to be a part of the coalition.
                                ProtectUMD respects this choice. No one organization is in charge of the coalition and
                                as such, the purpose of ProtectUMD is not to prioritize demands but uplift the needs of
                                all marginalized communities. As a result of this, we did not turn away any communities
                                that wished to stand with us. </p>
                            <p> In regards to the discrepancy with JStreet, the organization did decline the invitation
                                to join ProtectUMD due to their disagreement with a demand previously submitted. This
                                does not mean that ProtectUMD does not support their issues or want their personal
                                demands responded to. Again, the coalition does not prioritize demands submitted and is
                                not an exclusionary organization. Our aim is for all marginalized communities on the UMD
                                campus to feel at home, safe, and protected.” </p>
                            <p> In response to the Pro-Palestinian student communities' set of demands, the following
                                student leaders agreed to comment on behalf of their organizations: Sam Koralnik of
                                Terps for Israel, Sam Fishman of the Jewish Student Union, Ethan Weisbaum of J Street U,
                                and Miranda Mlilo of Students for Justice in Palestine. </p>
                            <p> The students offered opinions about the absence of the Jewish voice within the demands
                                and weighed in on their groups’ stances toward Israel Fest and the BDS Movement. The
                                demand list calls for the university to encourage discussion about “the Palestinians’
                                struggles and the Boycott Divest and Sanction movement without fear of consequences by
                                the university administration.” </p>
                            <p> The BDS Movement calls for boycott, divestment and sanctioning of the State of Israel as
                                a “response of solidarity with the Palestinian struggle for freedom, justice and
                                equality,” according to its website. Some argue that the movement’s tactics parallel
                                those of the South African Anti-Apartheid movement of the 1980s. </p>
                            <p> It’s been a divisive issue for universities nationwide. During the 2014-15 school year,
                                19 campuses voted on BDS resolutions, though none were likely to impact university
                                policy, according to the Anti-Defamation League. The ADL is committed to fighting the
                                movement. </p>
                            <p> “The delegitimization of Israel is at the heart of contemporary anti-Semitism,” the ADL
                                states on its website. “BDS is one of its most visible and dangerous manifestations.”

                            <p>None of the University of Maryland’s Jewish student groups or organizations signed on to
                                ProtectUMD’s list of demands. </p>
                            <p> ProtectUMD issued a statement to The Diamondback explaining why no Jewish groups were
                                represented: </p>
                            <p> “ProtectUMD is a coalition of organizations throughout the University of Maryland’s
                                campus dedicated to uniting the different voices into one voice for change. When the
                                coalition was created, multiple organizations were contacted to participate while others
                                contacted us themselves. Not all organizations chose to be a part of the coalition.
                                ProtectUMD respects this choice. No one organization is in charge of the coalition and
                                as such, the purpose of ProtectUMD is not to prioritize demands but uplift the needs of
                                all marginalized communities. As a result of this, we did not turn away any communities
                                that wished to stand with us. </p>
                            <p> In regards to the discrepancy with JStreet, the organization did decline the invitation
                                to join ProtectUMD due to their disagreement with a demand previously submitted. This
                                does not mean that ProtectUMD does not support their issues or want their personal
                                demands responded to. Again, the coalition does not prioritize demands submitted and is
                                not an exclusionary organization. Our aim is for all marginalized communities on the UMD
                                campus to feel at home, safe, and protected.” </p>
                            <p> In response to the Pro-Palestinian student communities' set of demands, the following
                                student leaders agreed to comment on behalf of their organizations: Sam Koralnik of
                                Terps for Israel, Sam Fishman of the Jewish Student Union, Ethan Weisbaum of J Street U,
                                and Miranda Mlilo of Students for Justice in Palestine. </p>
                            <p> The students offered opinions about the absence of the Jewish voice within the demands
                                and weighed in on their groups’ stances toward Israel Fest and the BDS Movement. The
                                demand list calls for the university to encourage discussion about “the Palestinians’
                                struggles and the Boycott Divest and Sanction movement without fear of consequences by
                                the university administration.” </p>
                            <p> The BDS Movement calls for boycott, divestment and sanctioning of the State of Israel as
                                a “response of solidarity with the Palestinian struggle for freedom, justice and
                                equality,” according to its website. Some argue that the movement’s tactics parallel
                                those of the South African Anti-Apartheid movement of the 1980s. </p>
                            <p> It’s been a divisive issue for universities nationwide. During the 2014-15 school year,
                                19 campuses voted on BDS resolutions, though none were likely to impact university
                                policy, according to the Anti-Defamation League. The ADL is committed to fighting the
                                movement. </p>
                            <p> “The delegitimization of Israel is at the heart of contemporary anti-Semitism,” the ADL
                                states on its website. “BDS is one of its most visible and dangerous manifestations.”

                            <p>Bibiana Valdes, an undocumented student and a junior electrical engineering major
                                attending this university under the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, does not
                                think a sole full-time immigration attorney, as demanded by ProtectUMD, would be enough
                                for undocumented students. Instead, she feels multiple attorneys would be best. </p>
                            <p> The Undergraduate Student Legal Aid Office has a third-party immigration attorney come
                                in once a month to help students seeking specific help with a case. </p>
                            <p> Valdes is an undocumented student who moved to Maryland from Mexico at age 9 and
                                qualifies under DACA, which exempts undocumented immigrants who meet certain age
                                requirements from deportation, gives them work permits and allows them to pay in-state
                                tuition at certain public universities. </p>
                            <p> "A group [of immigration attorneys] would be really good,” she said. “I would definitely
                                use that to my advantage in the case that something were to happen. Hopefully nothing
                                does." Syndy Shilling, director of the office, noted that any attorney services would be
                                a budgetary matter. </p>
                            <p> "Certainly we could assess, if the needs increase, whether we would be able to within
                                our current budget increase that time available,” Shilling said. </p>
                            <p> Shilling indicated this is "a wait-and-see period until the new administration takes
                                office, until we see really in reality what’s going to happen. A lot of this is just
                                hypothetical, but very real obviously in terms of the students’ concerns, so we
                                recognize that." </p>
                            <p> President-elect Donald Trump said while campaigning he would reverse President Obama’s
                                executive orders, which would terminate DACA. </p>

                                United for Movement and Action in Society spearheaded the movement to make this
                                university a sanctuary campus for undocumented students and students protected under
                                Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals.</p>

                                Government have all supported efforts to make this university a sanctuary campus. </p>
                            <p> The SGA’s proposed legislation would protect undocumented and DACAmented students from
                                federal immigration law or deportation should Trump call for mass deportation or
                                overturn DACA, which defers action for undocumented immigrants who meet certain
                                guidelines, gives them work permits and allows them to pay in-state tuition at some
                                public universities.</p>
                            <p> University spokeswoman Crystal Brown told The Diamondback last month that 113
                                undocumented undergraduate and graduate students at this university receive DACA
                                benefits, which lasts for two years and is renewable. </p>
                            <p> “This is a time of grave uncertainty and vulnerability for our students on DACA status,”
                                university President Wallace Loh wrote in a Nov. 21 campus-wide email. “They deserve our
                                support and our country needs them.” </p>
                            <p> On the campaign trail, Trump called Mexicans criminals and rapists and promised to build
                                a wall on the U.S.-Mexico border, deport all undocumented people and terminate DACA.
                            </p>
                            <p> Trump’s racist rhetoric directed toward immigrants and divisive promises have led to a
                                nationwide call for sanctuary campuses to protect undocumented and DACAmented students
                                from law enforcement officials and potential deportation. ProtectUMD is joining these
                                efforts. </p>
                            <p> Petitions are circulating across more than 150 schools, including Yale University,
                                several University of California schools and the University of Wisconsin, to fight for
                                sanctuary campus status. Multiple university presidents have come out in support of
                                vulnerable students and others have already declared themselves sanctuary campuses. </p>

                                school, even if it’s not guaranteed or successful,” she said. “As long as they’re
                                willing to stand behind me or any other undocumented person.” </p>
                            <p> President-elect Donald Trump said during his campaign he would overturn President
                                Obama's executive orders regarding immigration, which include Deferred Action for
                                Childhood Arrivals, a plan allowing undocumented immigrants who meet certain age
                                requirements to work and receive education. Trump has also promised deport millions of
                                undocumented people. </p>
                            <p> Student group Political Latinx United for Movement and Action in Society spearheaded the
                                movement to make the university a sanctuary campus, which would protect undocumented
                                students from deportation. </p>
                            <p> The Student Government Association, Residence Hall Association, Graduate Student
                                Government and University Senate have all supported this measure. University President
                                Wallace Loh wrote in an email to the student body in November that it’s critical to
                                stand behind undocumented students and DACA. </p>
                            <p> An undocumented student who wished to remain anonymous said she is afraid of the
                                future’s uncertainty and called on the university to do more. </p>
                            <p> “What will happen to my parents, and to me?” she said regarding the potential
                                termination of DACA. “I have no other options. If I’m not able to work, how am I
                                supposed to pay for school?” </p>
                            <p> She added that Loh’s speeches supporting undocumented and DACAmented students are too
                                focused on what the university has already done, while resources like the Office
                                Multicultural Involvement and Community Advocacy are struggling with funding. </p>

                            <p>Bibiana Valdes, an undocumented student and a junior electrical engineering major
                                attending this university under the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, does not
                                think a sole full-time immigration attorney, as demanded by ProtectUMD, would be enough
                                for undocumented students. Instead, she feels multiple attorneys would be best. </p>
                            <p> The Undergraduate Student Legal Aid Office has a third-party immigration attorney come
                                in once a month to help students seeking specific help with a case. </p>
                            <p> Valdes is an undocumented student who moved to Maryland from Mexico at age 9 and
                                qualifies under DACA, which exempts undocumented immigrants who meet certain age
                                requirements from deportation, gives them work permits and allows them to pay in-state
                                tuition at certain public universities. </p>
                            <p> "A group [of immigration attorneys] would be really good,” she said. “I would definitely
                                use that to my advantage in the case that something were to happen. Hopefully nothing
                                does." Syndy Shilling, director of the office, noted that any attorney services would be
                                a budgetary matter. </p>
                            <p> "Certainly we could assess, if the needs increase, whether we would be able to within
                                our current budget increase that time available,” Shilling said. </p>
                            <p> Shilling indicated this is "a wait-and-see period until the new administration takes
                                office, until we see really in reality what’s going to happen. A lot of this is just
                                hypothetical, but very real obviously in terms of the students’ concerns, so we
                                recognize that." </p>
                            <p> President-elect Donald Trump said while campaigning he would reverse President Obama’s
                                executive orders, which would terminate DACA. </p>

                            <p>This university does not employ a full-time undocumented student coordinator, said Jody
                                Heckman-Bose, an international student adviser . But Yvette Lerma Jones, the coordinator
                                for Latina/o/x Student Involvement and Advocacy in the Office of Multicultural
                                Involvement and Community Advocacy, acts as a resource for undocumented students. </p>
                            <p> Lerma Jones lends undocumented students support, legal resources and direction toward
                                potential scholarships, as well as providing a space where undocumented students can
                                meet people with shared experience and know they’re not alone on the campus, she said.
                            </p>
                            <p> “We talk a little bit about how classes are going, how academic life is going," she
                                said, "but that always ends up blending with how other life circumstances look like."
                            </p>
                            <p> Lerma Jones said she supports ProtectUMD’s demand for a full-time undocumented student
                                coordinator because it often feels like she is working multiple jobs under one title.
                            </p>
                            <p> “It is something that is very much needed on this campus,” she said, adding that in
                                addition to providing better and more thorough help, a full-time coordinator would
                                provide more consistency to undocumented students. </p>
                            <p> An undocumented student at this university, who wished to remain anonymous to protect
                                her identity, said she had no idea MICA existed until a few weeks ago, and has always
                                done her own research to answer questions. </p>
                            <p> “It would not only ease my own concerns — having someone that was knowledgeable about
                                the resources available — but my parents who just call me every day like, ‘Make sure you
                                do this, this and this,’” the junior computer science major said. “It would take a lot
                                of stress away.” </p>

                            <p> Bibiana Valdes, a junior electrical engineering major who moved to Maryland from Mexico
                                when she was nine, is an undocumented student at this university under Deferred Action
                                for Childhood Arrivals. </p>
                            <p> She said that while mandatory training for the entire faculty and staff would be “nice
                                to have,” it feels unrealistic because there are professors on the campus whose views
                                may align with President-elect Donald Trump’s. Trump said on the campaign trail he wants
                                to terminate DACA and deport mililons of undocumented people. </p>
                            <p> “It’s just going to make them even more hateful towards [undocumented students] if
                                they’re forced to do this,” she said. </p>
                            <p> Yvette Lerma Jones, who acts as a resource for undocumented students in the Office of
                                Multicultural Involvement and Community Advocacy, said there are two types of training:
                                the kind based on policy and the kind based on community-building. The former is more
                                feasible on this campus, she said. </p>
                            <p> “I dont think its necessarily feasible to ask everyone to sign on to be an ally to a
                                community they might not understand,” she said, adding that it’s important for campus
                                faculty members to be equipped to answer undocumented students’ concerns about
                                scholarships and resources. </p>
                            <p> Lerma Jones currently provides training once a month focused on helping faculty and
                                staff understand the experiences of undocumented students, and said there’s been a
                                higher demand since Trump won the presidency. </p>

                            <p>Junior architecture and Spanish major Tatiana Escobar moved to the United States from El
                                Salvador in 2000, and was a legal resident until she gained her citizenship this past
                                October.</p>
                            <p> Escobar said the expansion of mental health services for students of color, as
                                ProtectUMD demanded, would help them cope in the aftermath of the election.
                                President-elect Donald Trump called for a “total and complete shutdown” on Muslims
                                entering the country, called Mexicans rapists and questioned an Indiana judge’s ability
                                to do his job due to his Mexican heritage.</p>
                            <p> “The first couple of days after the election many of the students, you know mostly
                                minorities, they were very upset, many were crying, they didn’t believe what had just
                                happened,” Escobar said. “[Expanded counseling services] would help many students just
                                to try to understand and cope with the reality of what happened and what’s going to
                                happen in the next four years.”</p>
                            <p> The Counseling Center provides students free mental health services at this university.
                                The center declined to comment, but its website provides additional details on how it
                                currently supports diverse student groups.</p>
                            <p> “We strive to offer services and programs that are inclusive, and give voice to these
                                varied experiences, by providing a safe place to be heard, appreciated, and accepted,”
                                according to the center's website. “Staff members in the counseling service have
                                expertise in providing therapy, campus outreach, and consultation that welcomes and
                                celebrates human diversity.” </p>
                            <p> The center’s website has a section of resources it offers with a focus on diversity,
                                including group counseling sessions for women of color or LGBTQ, specific walk-in times
                                for foreign-born students, and a <a href="http://www.counseling.umd.edu/cs/diversity/"

                            <p>Mwewa Sumbwe, a junior community health major who moved to the United States from Zambia
                                in 2002, called the potential termination of Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals
                                program very stressful, and said she is unsure if she will be able to remain a student
                                here until graduation. </p>
                            <p> DACA exempts students like Sumbwe from deportation and allows them to work and pay
                                in-state tuition at public universities. ProtectUMD demanded that these students
                                continue receiving in-state tuition, regardless of whether President-elect Donald Trump
                                terminates the program. The coalition also demanded an opening of merit-scholarships and
                                an emergency fund for these students. </p>
                            <p> “Without [DACA] that literally takes away all my income,” Sumbwe said. “I pay part of my
                                own tuition as well, so it’s like everything’s coming out of pocket.” </p>
                            <p> "All of the scholarship requirements are all U.S. citizen or permanent resident ... you
                                can't ask like, 'what if you don't have that,' while at the same time revealing your
                                status," said an undocumented student who is here under DACA. The junior computer
                                science major who has asked to remain anonymous also said she feels that after Maryland
                                passed a state version of the DREAM Act, the university "at the very least could have
                                some sort of scholarship in place or endowment for one." </p>
                            <p> University System of Maryland spokesman Mike Lurie wrote in an email that the University
                                System of Maryland “is committed to providing all of our students a safe and supportive
                                educational environment. We will continue to comply with applicable federal and state
                                laws and regulations, including the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA),
                                which protects the privacy of student education records, and will respond as appropriate
                                to lawfully issued subpoenas and/or court orders.” </p>
                            <p> Lurie noted that any USM institution, such as the University of Maryland, College Park,
                                can choose to refrain from any voluntary participation with immigration enforcement
                                officials. </p>
                            <p> “That is sort of a guiding principle that the university system has sent to each campus
                                as they work through what now is a potential issue,” Lurie said. “Barack Obama is the
                                president of the United States, on January 20, Donald Trump becomes president. We don’t
                                know what changes are coming” based on Trump’s rhetoric. </p>
                            <p> Lurie added that the state’s DREAM Act, a state law that allows undocumented students
                                who meet certain requirements to pay in-state tuition rates at public colleges and
                                universities, will remain unchanged regardless of what happens to DACA under the Trump
                                administration. </p>
                            <p> “That doesn’t change, and we continue to stand by that policy and that practice,” he
                                said. </p>
                            <p> Maryland passed the DREAM Act in 2012, which requires that undocumented students have
                                the opportunity to graduate from a public high school, earn 60 credits or an associate’s
                                degree at a state community college and provide documentation that they or their parents
                                have paid state taxes in order to receive a tuition discount. </p>
